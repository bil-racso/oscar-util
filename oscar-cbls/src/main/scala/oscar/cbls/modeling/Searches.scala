   *                   If none is provided, all the array will be considered each time
   * @param symmetryClassOfVariables a function that input the ID of a variable and returns a symmetry class;
   *                      ony one of the variable in each class will be considered to make search faster
   *                      Int.MinValue is considered different to itself
   *                      if you set to None this will not be used at all
   *                      variables of the same class with different values will not be considered as symmetrical

   *                             (this is only useful if your model is awfully expensive to evaluate)
   * @param domain a function that receives a variable and its Id in the vars array
   *               and returns the domain that is searched for the variable
   *               by default, the domain of the variable is explored
   * @param hotRestart  if true, the exploration order in case you ar not going for the best is a hotRestart
   *                    even if you specify a searchZone that is: the exploration starts again
   *                    at the position where it stopped, and consider the indices in increasing order
   *                    if false, consider the exploration range in natural order from the first position.
